            	<h2>November 2011 <span>New update!</span></h2>

            	<p><strong>The world&rsquo;s first Earthship school is almost complete!</strong></p>

            	<p>In October 2011, a crew of over 30 people, including the American architect and creator of Earthship, Michael Reynolds, worked for ten days to build 2 classrooms and teach locals the Earthship building methods. Please see our <a href="/earthship.htm">Earthship page</a> for the latest photos from the build. More classrooms are being added along the way, bringing us ever closer to the vision of The Goderich Waldorf School, Sierra Leone.</p>

            <!--<h2>September - December 2005</h2>

            <p>We had Michaelmas on September 24th, 2005 (instead of Sept. 28th). This was a double occasion to give a traditional farewell to Abu who was travelling to a foreign land. Through Archangel Michael, we hoped that we could be guided from evil, and also that the spirit goodness, love and justice will ever live with us individually and as a community. The occasion was closed with a cultural dance.</p>

            <p>We also had three field trips between October and November. Classes 1 &amp; 2 visited the Parliament building in Freetown; Class 2, State house; and Class 4 went to the National Sea Port.</p>

            <p> We continue to make traditional costumes for each class and for our school main dance group. We had a Christmas play for the first time this year. This occasion brought to our school different people of various religious faiths in the community.</p>

            <h2>January-March 2006</h2>

            <p>I still continue to engage senior officials at the Ministry of Education regarding the approval of the school as a government policy. In fact, I have had talks with the Deputy Minister of Education and he continues to show interest. Our main difficulty is that our application file continues to&quot; crawl sluggishly&quot; through the administrative channels.</p>

            <p>The school now has a part-time creative arts teacher, Tina Kawa. She is already a trained teacher but currently studying for a diploma in&nbsp; HIV/AIDS counselling.</p>

            <p>We also continue to look for suitable land to purchase or lease (for 100 years!) and the school advisory board is working on this.</p>

            <h2>Visitors</h2>

            <p>We shall be receiving Nana Gobel and Mrs. Schiller from Germany from May 17-15, 2006.</p>

            <p>Elaine Holt, from the Ringwood Waldorf School, Herts UK, will be in Sierra Leone for two weeks (May 15-26). Note that Elaine is a lecturer at the London Waldorf Teacher Training Seminar, where Kelly and I studied Waldorf education. It is my pleasure to have her in Sierra Leone so that others will benefit from her fantastic painting lessons, etc.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>

            <h3>Short Term</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Get government approval for the existence of the school as an independent school.</li>
                <li>Teaching and Learning Materials: We will engage in making our own exercise books.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Medium Term</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Make local necklaces, bracelets and African dresses to be sold abroad for fundraising to meet our running/other costs.</li>
                <li>Building of a makeshift classroom near the current building to accommodate class 5 by September, 2006.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Long Term</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Finding experienced Waldorf teachers from abroad who will volunteer to train our teachers for one month (preferably August) every year.</li>
                <li>Land and school building.</li>
            </ul>-->
