Past experience has told me that the only way to deliver
up to date, accurate information to my clients is to host
the documentation online.

That said, here is the basic procedure:

1- FTP the ufm directory to your server
2- Go to www.yoursite.com/ufm/

I will be sure to have a very obvious 'BUY' link on the site. ;)



*Discounts

I offer volume discounts.  The more you buy, the more you save.


*Special Discounts

Currently, I have a special PROMO CODE you can get to lower
the cost of Ultimate Form Mail and get some unique bonuses.

To get the PROMO CODE for the steep discount, go to 
www.ultimateformmail.com
and look for the link to download your free trial of the software.
There should be a form where you can enter your name and email to
get your PROMO CODE and bonuses.

The two bonuses are:

"101 Ways to Get Tons of Links Pointing at Your Website"   (PDF)
"30 List Building Strategies for 2007"  (PDF)

The first report I got special permission from one of the leading
search engine optimization experts to create and compile from things
he had written on the subject of link building.  Very powerful ideas.
Not the typical dribble you see sold in ebooks.

The second report I wrote from scratch.  It's my experience - wins
and losses - as surrounding building and maintaining a healthy 
newsletter list.  I cover a few dumb mistakes I've made and give you
my thoughts on what's working now.  There's plenty of meat to this
report and I'm certain you'll see some new ideas.


Refunds

I hardly ever need to offer one, but it's yours for the asking.

The fastest way to get one is through my support ticket system
