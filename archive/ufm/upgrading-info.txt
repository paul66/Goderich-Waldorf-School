Upgrading to 3.5.0


New from 3.2.7

1) Made file upload field names available in mail merge template
2) Added controls.php switcher
3) Added config file for antispam token session code
4) Make it possible to require files

New files:

tokenCofig.php - doesn't really come into play unless you turn on
$set['spamBlock'] = '0'; by changing to '1'

For more info on this, see my knowledge base at
http://www.jackborn.com/support/ 
Look under video tutorials for info on Spam Block setup.

The spam block is an optional convenience that is very handy, but
not required for Ultimate Form Mail to be safe.

Basically, it does the job of a CAPTCHA (ransom note) without images
or user input required. Google the word CAPTCHA for more info.


Changes to controls.php

1) optional token settings moved to tokenConfig.php
2) $set['required_filefields'] = array('file1','file2');  sets an array of required file upload field names.
Off by default. Remove leading // to turn on. Under category - Upload attachments in controls.php


Big change

[Optional - Not required - Just a new feature]

controls.php switcher
This is new code that makes it much easier to have multiple forms on one website
with just one install of Ultimate Form Mail. Here's how it works.

1) The default config file is controls.php
2) You can set up multiple controls.php files with the following naming conventions
controls-x.php
controlsx.php
Where x is any NUMBER
3) You can start out of order (controls103.php)
4) You tell Ultimate Form Mail which config file to grab like so:
<form action="/ufm/mailit.php?cid=54" method="post" (etc...)
In this case, controls-54.php or controls54.php will be sought.
5) If the file you specify is not found, then it reverts back to controls.php (default)
6) It's strongly recommended to have a default config file named controls.php
