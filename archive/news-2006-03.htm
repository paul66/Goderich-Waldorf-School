			<h2>January-March 2006</h2>

            <p>I still continue to engage senior officials at the Ministry of Education regarding the approval of the school as a government policy. In fact, I have had talks with the Deputy Minister of Education and he continues to show interest. Our main difficulty is that our application file continues to&quot; crawl sluggishly&quot; through the administrative channels.</p>

            <p>The school now has a part-time creative arts teacher, Tina Kawa. She is already a trained teacher but currently studying for a diploma in&nbsp; HIV/AIDS counselling.</p>

            <p>We also continue to look for suitable land to purchase or lease (for 100 years!) and the school advisory board is working on this.</p>

            <h2>Visitors</h2>

            <p>We shall be receiving Nana Gobel and Mrs. Schiller from Germany from May 17-15, 2006.</p>

            <p>Elaine Holt, from the Ringwood Waldorf School, Herts UK, will be in Sierra Leone for two weeks (May 15-26). Note that Elaine is a lecturer at the London Waldorf Teacher Training Seminar, where Kelly and I studied Waldorf education. It is my pleasure to have her in Sierra Leone so that others will benefit from her fantastic painting lessons, etc.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>

            <h3>Short Term</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Get government approval for the existence of the school as an independent school.</li>
                <li>Teaching and Learning Materials: We will engage in making our own exercise books.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Medium Term</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Make local necklaces, bracelets and African dresses to be sold abroad for fundraising to meet our running/other costs.</li>
                <li>Building of a makeshift classroom near the current building to accommodate class 5 by September, 2006.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Long Term</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Finding experienced Waldorf teachers from abroad who will volunteer to train our teachers for one month (preferably August) every year.</li>
                <li>Land and school building.</li>
            </ul>
