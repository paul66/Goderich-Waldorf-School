      <h2>November 2011 <span>New update!</span></h2>
      <p><strong>The world&rsquo;s first Earthship school is almost complete!</strong></p>

Please see our <a href="/earthship.htm">Earthship page</a> for the latest photos from the build. More classrooms are being added along the way, bringing us ever closer to the vision of The Goderich Waldorf School, Sierra Leone.</p>
